# MetaRoom dApp

## Project Overview
MetaRoom is a decentralized application (dApp) that enables users to create, own, and manage virtual rooms as NFTs on the blockchain. Room owners can approve guests, and all permissions are managed on-chain. The dApp features a simple UI and a 3D virtual room visualization.

## Features
- Mint unique Room NFTs (ERC-721)
- Approve guests for each room
- Check guest approval status
- 3D virtual room using A-Frame
- MetaMask wallet integration
- On-chain access control

## Tech Stack
- **Solidity** (RoomNFT smart contract)
- **Hardhat** (development & deployment)
- **ethers.js** (frontend blockchain interaction)
- **A-Frame** (3D virtual room)
- **MetaMask** (wallet integration)
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript** (frontend)

## How to Run
1. **Clone the repository**
2. **Install dependencies** (for contract deployment):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. **Deploy the contract** (using Hardhat):
   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network sepolia
   ```
4. **Update the contract address** in `frontend/script.js` (`CONTRACT_ADDRESS`)
5. **Open `frontend/index.html` in your browser**

## Demo Instructions
- Connect your MetaMask wallet
- Mint a Room NFT
- Approve guests by entering their address and room ID
